## Cache Lab  
this lab is related to *CS:APP* **Chapter 5: Optimizing Program Performance** and **Chapter 6: The Memory Hierachy**  

### Point
* Part A: Cache Simulator ([csim.c](https://github.com/dongdongyang33/study/blob/master/CMU/15213/Lab4_Cache/cachelab-handout/csim.c))  
>> You have to know what the cache memory should looked like and how is it work.  
* Part B: Optimizing Matrix Transpose ([trans.c](https://github.com/dongdongyang33/study/blob/master/CMU/15213/Lab4_Cache/cachelab-handout/trans.c))  
>> Better understand for cache and optimizing the program
